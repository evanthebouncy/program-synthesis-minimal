Program synthesis is useful -- Who wouldn't want to make a computer that automatically writes programs? However, there is a knowledge gap between how to build state of the art program synthesis algorithms and what is generally known about it. This gap is _much bigger than it needs to be_. This blog aims to shrink this knowlege gap, so that you can start applying program synthesis to your own works. We will cover both the concepts of program synthesis -- so you can have a framework to think and talk about it, and the toolings required to implement these algorithms -- so you can get the job done.

# why am I writing it
Program synthesis currently occupies a knowledge space between active research and a standardized undergraduate curriculum, and a blog is the best way to disseminate knowledge of this kind. I believe as humans and computers continue to work in collaboration, the distinction between programming, program-synthesis, and naturalistic communication will continue to blur. I hope people can view programming as more than typing obscure green characters onto an uncompromising black terminal, and build systems that are as empathetic as they are efficient.
