Program synthesis is useful -- Who wouldn't want to make a computer that automatically writes programs? As humans and computers continue to work in collaboration, the distinction between programming, program-synthesis, and naturalistic communication will continue to blur. However, there is a knowledge gap between how to build state of the art program synthesis algorithms and what is generally known about it. This gap is _much bigger than it needs to be_. This blog aims to shrink this knowlege gap, so that you can start applying program synthesis to your own works. We will cover both the concepts of program synthesis -- so you can have a framework to think and talk about it, and the bare-minimum toolings required to implement these algorithms -- so you can start iterating on solutions. Ultimately, I hope researchers and system-builders can view "programming" as more than typing obscure green characters onto an uncompromising black terminal, and build systems that are as empathetic as they are efficient.
