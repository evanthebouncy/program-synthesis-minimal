Program synthesis is useful -- Who wouldn't want to make a computer that automatically writes programs? However, there is a knowledge gap between how to build SOTA program synthesis algorithms and what is generally known about it. This gap is _much bigger than it needs to be_. This blog aims to shrink this knowlege gap, so that you can start applying program synthesis to your own works. We will cover both concepts of program synthesis -- so you can think and talk about it, and the toolings required to implement these algorithms -- so you can get the job done.
